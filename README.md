## About

This repo aims to house all the code necessary to play music through other services

## Idea

The idea is pretty simple, say you have a playlist on Apple Music, but want to have it also on Spotify? I think that you should't have to maintain both. Both services have APIs and ways that you can play their music. So what if there was an adapter that allowed you to use their service, or any other service that you have to play a song?
